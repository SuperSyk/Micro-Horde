# Micro Horde
A game where you try and recruit as many NPCs as possible and then survive as long as you can.

## Instructions
-> ARROW KEYS to move
-> Run into NPCs (blue) to recruit them (black)
-> Avoid zombies (green)
--> Zombies will try and infect NPCs as well
-> Press/hold SPACE to shoot
--> As soon as you shoot all hell will break loose
-> If you lose all health (see top right red) you die
-> Press R to restart

## Power Ups
There are six power ups:
1. Invincibility
-> Immune for five seconds
-> Run into zombies to kill them

2. Nuke
-> Instantly kills all zombies on screen

3. Speed
-> Run at twice the speed for five seconds

4. Slow
-> Slow all zombies for five seconds

5. Reinforcements
-> More teammates spawn

6. Heal
-> Fully heal health back to 100

## Challenge
Feel like the game is too easy? Run into the red square in the middle to activate hard mode (must do it before shooting).
